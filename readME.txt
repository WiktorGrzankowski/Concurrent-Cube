------------------
Program performs rotations on a digital Rubic's Cube of a given size.
It allows for up to 3 rotations of different layers of the same
axis on a 3x3 cube, in general up to K rotations on a KxK cube.
Method show() prints the current state of the cube.
Semaphores and atomic variables to synchronize rotations
between axes and the show() method.
Tests written using JUnit are an addition to prove
correctness of Cube class.
